    # Go into the correct terminal in the directory (ex - HelloWorld)
    # git status
    # see files which have not been commited in required
    # git add .
    # git status
    # se files turn to green meaning that you've updated them locally?
    # git commit -m 'add comment here about what you changed'
    # git status
    # git push
    # check the 'HelloWorld' or other repository for updates in Github

# To create new repo...
    # Go into the correct terminal in the directory (ex - HelloWorld)
    # git init
    # git status
    # git add .
    # git status
    # git commit -m 'add comment here about what you changed'
    # git status
    # git push

    # Note: something about defaulting to remote location if not specified which
    # should be GitHub for both HelloWorld and python-workshop at this point but
    # if you make a new repo you might have to go through a different process
